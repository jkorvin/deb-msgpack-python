Package: python-msgpack
Provides: msgpack-python,
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends},
         ${python:Depends},
         ${shlibs:Depends},
Description: Python implementation of MessagePack format
 MessagePack is a binary-based efficient object serialization format.
 It enables the exchange of structured objects between many languages
 like JSON.  But unlike JSON, it is very fast and small.
 .
 This package contains a Python extension module implementing the
 MessagePack format.
